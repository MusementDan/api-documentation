# Musement Glossary

* **Customer**: the customer is the one that makes the purchase. He can be one of the passengers or not. In any cart there must be one and only one customer.

* **Open ticket**: Musement events can have a specific date, e.g. a football match, or can be valid for a limited time span, e.g. an entrance ticket valid for the next 365 days. In the first case the property open_tycket would be "no", in the second case would be "yes"

* **Passenger**: the passenger is the one who will benefit the ticket. In any cart there can be many passengers or any. Not every product requires info about passengers


* **Seat price**: this is the single product that can be added to the cart. The seat price identifies a specific time slot, with a specific ticket holder for a specific event.
